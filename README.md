### About

Objective - To get a clear understanding of how do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. Dataset can be found [here]( https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html )

Q.1) What business tasks need to be accomplished?

Ans – 1) The business task that needs to be accomplished was to design a marketing strategy to convert the casual riders into annual members.

Q.2) What data is needed to accomplish this task & describe the information being used?

Ans – 2) We are using 12 months of cyclists’ data from Apr-2019 till Mar-2020, which included the customers who were either annual members or casual riders and the start-time and end-time of each bicycle trip. Data used in the project is public data that you can use to explore how different customer types are using Cyclistic bike-share services.

Q.3) Cleaning & Manipulating the dataset for analysis?

Ans – 3) The dataset contained 12 columns, which included numeric & non-numeric parameters. Two more columns were derived later to calculate the total length of each ride a customer took & the other column determined which day of the week it is. The dataset was cleaned using R, which included renaming columns, changing data-types of some features etc.

### Summary of Analysis

Q.1) How do annual members & casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?

• The average trip length for customers who are annual members is significantly low when compared with casual riders.

• The frequency of the trips made by customers who are annual members is much higher than that of casual riders.
